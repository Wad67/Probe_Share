Fully 3d rendered cockpit, with RTCAM texture for window, showing hood of spacecraft

Spacecraft are rediculous petroleum and diesel powered creations

All controls should be visible in pixel art / gritty style overlayed into cockpit

Yaw control is yanking a steering wheel forward and back

Player arms should move in a funny programatic way depending on what control is being used

Guns should have visible autoloaders and shit clanking around, obscuring view

Taking damage visibly disrupts / damages cockpit

If you aren't wearing spacesuit and glass is fucked display horrendous animation of your face being sucked through the glass

If you are wearing a spacesuit and have a gun in your posession you may do drive by shootings, etc


General gameplay loop - Friendly town, upgrade, crew, whatever - Roam, kill shit, explore, find another friendly town
Quests inbetween, trading between towns

Fuel / Oxygen for engines and breathing / radiator water

Light speed is going plaid from spaceballs

You rule over a small civilization that lives in the back seat, it performs crafting operations in exchange for narcotics
